# Use the Windows ML APIs

With Windows ML, you'll use the APIs to execute 3 major activities:

1. Load
2. Bind
3. Evaluate

Definitions:

* Model: A fully trained ML model that has been saved/exported into the ONNX file format.
* Feature: an input or output for a ML model
* FeatureDescriptor: a schema definition for a feature
* FeatureValue: an actual instantiated value for a feature
* Tensor: a strongly typed multi-dimensional array.
* Device: Where you want to run the ML model. You can either run them on the CPU, or you can run them on a DirectX device. 
* Session: everything you need to run an ML model. The model, with a chosen device, gives you a session. 
* Bindings: where you bind your FeatureValueâ€™s to the inputs and outputs for that session. Any transformations that need to be done on the inputs are done during Bind().
* Evaluation: the act of running the model. Processing the inputs and producing the outputs.

## Load

## Bind

## Evaluate
