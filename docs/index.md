# Windows AI

Windows AI is the AI platform for Windows developers. With WinRT APIs, developers can take advantage of hardware optimizations and interchangeable AI models to build intelligent applications on Windows devices.

## Windows ML

As part of the Windows AI platform, Windows ML is a set of [WinRT APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/windows.ai.machinelearning.preview) (C# and C++) that evaluate machine learning models locally on Windows devices. Windows ML provides hardware-accelerated performance by leveraging the device's CPU or GPU, and computes evaluations for both classical ML algorithms and Deep Learning.
