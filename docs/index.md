# Windows ML

With Windows ML, you can use trained machine learning models in your Windows apps.

## Overview

:::row:::
    :::column:::
    Windows ML is a set of [WinRT APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/windows.ai.machinelearning) that allow you to use trained machine learning models in your Windows applications (C# and C++). Windows ML evaluates trained [ONNX models](https://onnx.ai) locally on Windows devices, providing hardware-optimized performance by leveraging the device's CPU or GPU.
