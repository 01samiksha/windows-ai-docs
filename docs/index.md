# Windows ML

With Windows ML, you can use trained machine learning models in your Windows apps.

## Overview

Windows ML is a set of [WinRT APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/windows.ai.machinelearning) that allow you to use trained machine learning models in your Windows applications (C# and C++). Windows ML evaluates trained [ONNX models](https://onnx.ai) locally on Windows devices, providing hardware-optimized performance by leveraging the device's CPU or GPU.

To use Windows ML, you'll add an ONNX model to your app, and integrate it into your app's code with the WinML APIs.
