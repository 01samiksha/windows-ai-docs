# Windows ML

With Windows ML, you can integrate trained machine learning models in your Windows apps.

![Windows ML graphic](images/winml-graphic.png)

## Overview

:::row:::
    :::column:::
    Windows ML allows you to use trained machine learning models in your Windows apps (C# and C++). The Windows ML inference engine evaluates trained models locally on Windows devices, removing concerns of connectivity, bandwidth, and data privacy. Hardware optimizations for CPU and GPU additionally enable high performance for quick evaluation results.

## Develop

![windows ml developer flow](images/winml-flow.png)

To use machine learning in your Windows apps with Windows ML, you'll:

1. [Get a trained ONNX model](get-onnx-model.md).
1. Add the model to your app.
1. [Integrate the model](integrate-model.md) into your app's code.
1. Run on any Windows device!

To learn how to develop with Windows ML, take a look through our documentation.
