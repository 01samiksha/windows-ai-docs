# Windows Machine Learning

With Windows ML, you can integrate trained machine learning models in your Windows apps.

## Overview

:::row:::
    :::column:::
    Windows ML allows you to use trained machine learning models in your Windows apps (C#, C++, and JavaScript). The Windows ML inference engine evaluates trained models locally on Windows devices, removing concerns of connectivity, bandwidth, and data privacy. Hardware optimizations for CPU and GPU additionally enable high performance for quick evaluation results.

    For the latest Windows ML features and fixes, see our [release notes](release-notes.md).

## Develop

![windows ml developer flow](images/winml-flow.png)

To build apps with Windows ML, you'll:

1. [Get a trained ONNX model](get-onnx-model.md), or convert models trained in other ML frameworks into ONNX with [WinMLTools](convert-model-winmltools.md).
1. Add the ONNX model file to your app.
1. [Integrate the model](integrate-model.md) into your app's code.
1. Run on any Windows device!

To see Windows ML in action, you can try out the sample apps in the [Windows-Machine-Learning](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-Machine-Learning/tree/master) repo on Github. To learn more about using Windows ML, take a look through our documentation.

> [!NOTE]
> Windows ML is a **pre-released** product which may be substantially modified before itâ€™s commercially released. Microsoft makes no warranties, express or implied, with respect to the information provided here.
>
> To try out the pre-released Windows ML, you'll need the [Windows 10 Insider Preview](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windowsinsiderpreviewiso) (Build 17728 or higher) and the [Windows 10 SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windowsinsiderpreviewSDK) (Build 17723 or higher).

### Using WinML APIs in C++

While the WinML APIs are available in both C++/CX and C++/WinRT, we recommend using the C++/WinRT version, as it allows for more natural C++ coding and is where most development efforts will be focused going forward. You can follow the instructions below that pertain to your particular situation to use the C++/WinRT APIs:

* If you are creating a new C++ application, see [Tutorial: Create a Windows Machine Learning Desktop application (C++)](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/ai/get-started-desktop) and follow the steps up to **Load the model**.
* If you have an existing C++ application (which is not already set up for C++/WinRT), follow these steps to set up your application for C++/WinRT:
    1. Make sure you have the latest version of [Visual Studio 2017](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) installed (any edition).
    2. Make sure you have the [SDK for Windows 10](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk), version 1803 or later.
    3. Download and install the [C++/WinRT Visual Studio Extension (VSIX)](https://aka.ms/cppwinrt/vsix) from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/).
    4. Add the `<CppWinRTEnabled>true</CppWinRTEnabled>` property to the project's .vcxproj file:
        ```xml
        <Project ...>
            <PropertyGroup Label="Globals">
                <CppWinRTEnabled>true</CppWinRTEnabled>
        ...
        ```
    5. C++/WinRT requires features from the C++17 standard, so in your project properties, set **C/C++ > Language > C++ Language Standard > ISO C++17 Standard (/std:c++17)**.
    6. Set **Conformance mode: Yes (/permissive-)** in your project properties.\
    7. Another project property to be aware of is **C/C++ > General > Treat Warnings As Errors**. Set this to **Yes (/WX)** or **No (/WX-)** to taste. Sometimes, source files generated by the **cppwinrt.exe** tool generate warnings until you add your implementation to them.
    8. The VSIX also gives you Visual Studio native debug visualization (natvis) of C++/WinRT projected types, providing an experience similar to C# debugging. Natvis is automatic for debug builds. You can opt into its release builds by defining the symbol **WINRT_NATVIS**.
    9. Your project should now be setup for C++/WinRT. See [C++/WinRT](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/cpp-and-winrt-apis/) for more information.
