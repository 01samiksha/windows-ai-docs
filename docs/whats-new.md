# What's new?

## August 2018

The latest pre-release version of Windows ML is available through the Windows 10 SDK - Insider Preview Build 17709.

### ONNX version 1.2

Windows ML now supports ONNX v1.2 as minimum model version. Check out our [Overview](overview.md) for more information on how to obtain models in the 1.2 version of the format.

### Support for FP16 datatypes

Windows ML now supports GPU-based model inferences using FP16 datatypes, providing better performance and reduced model footprint. Learn more about how to convert your models from FP32 to FP16 by using WinMLTools in the [Convert existing models to ONNX](winmltools.md#convert-to-fp16) page.

### WinRT/C++ for desktop apps

Windows ML now supports desktop apps with [WinRT/C++](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/cpp-and-winrt-apis/). Learn how to use Windows ML with your desktop app in [Get started (Desktop)](get-started-desktop.md).
