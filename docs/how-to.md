# How to develop with Windows ML

The Windows ML APIs are WinRT APIs consummable in both C# and C++. You can call the APIs from your application's code, and follow the [load, bind, evaluate](integrate-model.md) pattern to integrate your model into your app.

## Basics

- [Get an ONNX model](get-onnx-model.md)
- [Convert a model to ONNX](conversion-samples.md)
- [Integrate a model into your app](integrate-model.md)
